BY USING THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS.

<p>This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms and Part 2 - Country-unique Terms and is the complete agreement regarding the use of this Program, and replaces any prior oral or written communications between You and IBM. The terms of Part 2 may replace or modify those of Part 1.
<p><font size=4 color="#602162">Part 1 - General Terms</font>
<p>The Program is owned by IBM or one of its subsidiaries or a supplier of IBM, and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold. The term &quot;Program&quot; means the original program and all whole or partial copies of it. A Program consists of machine-readable instructions, its components, data, audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), and related licensed materials. 
<p><font size=3 color="#810000">License </font>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, IBM grants You a world-wide, non-exclusive license to download, reproduce, execute, display, perform, copy, modify, distribute the Program and derivative works thereof.
<p>You will ensure that anyone who uses the Program or derivative works thereof does so only in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. You may not use the Program except as provided in this Agreement or sublicense, rent, or lease the Program.
<p>In return You grant IBM a world-wide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, cost-free license to download, reproduce, execute, display, perform, copy, modify, distribute Your derivative works of the Program, said license including the right to sublicense it to subsidiaries, affiliates and third parties and for those to sublicense it to others.

<p>SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES WHICH CAN NOT BE EXCLUDED, THE COMPANY MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, REGARDING THE PROGRAM OR TECHNICAL SUPPORT, IF ANY.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
<p><font size=3 color="#810000">Export Regulations</font>
