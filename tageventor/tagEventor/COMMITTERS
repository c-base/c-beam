The following people have commit access to the tagEventor sources which are hosted in the "tageventor" Google Code project at http://code.google.com/p/tageventor

Other people may have contributed to the project via patches submitted, and committed by someone on this list. Those other contributors should be recognized in the commit log for the relevant change, hence the log is the final source of all information on who was the source of a contribution.

If you have a question or comment, it's probably best to mail info@autelic.org,
